**Spotify Mood Classification Project**

**Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing the Spotify Recommendation dataset to classify songs based on their mood, utilizing a variety of data science and machine learning techniques. The analysis involves initial data exploration, feature engineering, and the development of machine learning and deep learning models to predict the mood of songs from their attributes.

**Dataset**

The dataset used in this project includes various attributes of songs from the Spotify music streaming platform, such as danceability, energy, tempo, and user behavior like song listens and playlist creation. It's structured to help in developing algorithms that can recommend songs to users based on their listening habits and preferences.

**Structure**

The project is organized as follows:

**Data Exploration:** Understanding the structure of the dataset, including the number of records, features, and preliminary statistics.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing data distributions and relationships to gain insights into the dataset.

**Feature Engineering:** Creating new features that could better represent the data for modeling purposes, such as song duration in minutes and a composite 'intensity' feature.

**Mood Classification:** Categorizing songs into mood-based groups using song attributes like valence, energy, and tempo.

**Machine Learning Models:** Developing and evaluating several machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

**Deep Learning Model:** Building a neural network model to classify songs based on their features.

**Tools and Libraries**

The project utilizes Python as the primary programming language, with the following key libraries:

Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
Scikit-learn for machine learning model development
XGBoost for gradient boosting models
TensorFlow for deep learning models
